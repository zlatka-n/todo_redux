# Todo Redux

Although there are millions of todo lists, I decided to also create one - I wanted to create something that I'd be able to finish. My first todo app was created in React JS. Later I decided to recreate it with Redux. This was probably my first Redux project and finishing this, I learnt why people choose Redux for state management.

## This todo can:

do CRUD operations for todos

You can view the todo app here https://eshop-redux-zlatka-n.vercel.app/. Colors were chosen from Adobe color pallete.

## Tech stack (libraries) used:

- React JS
- Redux
- React Icons
